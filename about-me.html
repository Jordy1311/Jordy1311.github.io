              <h3 id="about-me-info-general">I'm an amature software developer who is tryin things out, loves a laugh and thoroughly enjoy all things genuine! More than happy to geek out about coffee or tech or mostly anything else; I am a fairly big nerd and love to know how all things tick.</h3>
              <p id="about-me-info-specific">My software life started around the beginning of 2021; with about 5 years of an unfulfilling job behind me and a cherished friend by my side, I took the plunge into software with full gusto! I have found a world of unlimited possibilities that is incredibly progressive and filled with friendly people who only want to build on more and more greatness. <br><br>I am currently going through a developer-bootcamp in Wellington but am totally up for collaboration. Feel free to look through my GitHub and reach out to me on the details below. <br><br>On this little site will be a series of blogs and it might expand to include some pretty cool stuff in the future. It also might not hah! Regardless, you should:<br><br> WATCH THIS SPACE!!</p>
