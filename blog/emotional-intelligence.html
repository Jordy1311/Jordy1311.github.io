            <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
            <p>Emotional intelligence is one's ability to connect with their own and other's experiences and be able to communicate and understand those experiences</p>
            <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
            <p>The difference between IQ and EQ could be seen as the difference between dinner and dessert. They involve the same things but they are very different and you should deffinately find a way to have both. No haha! I would say that that IQ differs by the subject being your interaction with some thing over your experience with your and other's emotions.</p>
            <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
            <p>I see EQ as the base of a pyramid - it is extremely important for you to have a strong base in order for your pyramid to become any significant height. In more common words: having strong EQ skills allows you to better exercise your IQ. You could have strong IQ skills and weak EQ skills and be able to easily work on something but not be able to listen to yourself or others - very clear problem for one's wellbeing and team productive levels/wellness. On the other hand you could have strong EQ skills and weak IQ skills which would mean that you can listen to yourself and other's very effectivly but might not have technical knowledge for example, but that would be easily overcome with the high EQ skills.</p>
