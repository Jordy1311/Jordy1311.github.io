            <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
            <p>
              Not a lot here has changed! I am still looking to get more well rounded with big focus on those people skills. To answer the new second part of this question, I would just like to have an impact wherever I go. I feel like there is big potential with software that is yet to be harvested in certain areas of life (health sectors, education) and I would quite like to be a part of that harvesting potentially in those areas.

            <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
            <p>
              Reviewing what I put as my strengths and weaknesses in my first post, I very much agree that they will still be my strengths and weaknesses going into Bootcamp - namely: confidence in groups with raising and challenging ideas, speeches and presentations.
            </p>
            <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
            <p>
              To take straight from my weaknesses from the question above, having confidence when working with others and in groups. I don’t like confrontation so if my ideas conflict with someone else’s but I have a strong feeling my idea is better, I am going to have to figure a way to raise this in a constructive way. I think general practice in this after maybe finding out how is the only way I can get used to this.
            </p>
            <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
            <p>
              Presentational, confrontation handling, idea sharing, feedback.
            </p>
            <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
            <p>
              For me it is more of the same, being there, willing to answer silly questions and patient when I do things wrong over and over again haha!
            </p>
            <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h2>
            <p>
              I luckily have quite a bit of experience coming into Dev Academy, that being said, I will still need help for sure and I think I am confident enough to ask for help when I need it.
            </p>
            <p>
              With this workload, I am really going to have to stick to the curriculum and make sure I am taking note of the learning outcomes. In the foundation sections, I was able to play a lot with my knowledge and still be able to catch up/push ahead when I needed/wanted. I think I would like to spend more of the time pushing ahead while making sure that I fully grasp concepts before pushing further because there will be a lot more new stuff in Bootcamp for me than what we covered in foundations.

            <h1>MY LEARNING PLAN - FOUNDATIONS</h1>
            <p class="post-date-post">2 July 2021</p>
            <h2>Long term goal and/or career pathway:</h2>
            <p>My 15 week longterm goal at Dev Academy would be to become a more rounded developer. I completely understand the need for some knowledge but I love that there is a need for more people who have both good people skills and the ability to learn when facing difficulties. We are in a world where things are constantly updating with new releases and these two key skills is a solid way through it, making way for the creation of more great things.</p>
            <h2>My strengths and limitations in learning:</h2>
            <p>My strengths include being patient and trusting that the curriculum and facilitators are working in my best interest and other general things like picking things up fast and asking questions that solidify understanding. I think where I have limitations is having the confidence to raise points of conflict where a matter is subjective or presenting to bigger groups! Speeches give me anxiety but not because I don't have well informed opinions or because I don't know something - I think it has to do with judgement or something!</p>
            <h2>Skills I would like to see developed:</h2>
            <p>Those people skills that bring more collaboration: presentation, group problem solving. More understanding around bigger concepts as well. I know that it would be hard to fit the whole development world in 15 weeks but at least having conceptual understand of best practices would give me confidence in what I am doing and why.</p>
            <h2>How will I manage my workload:</h2>
            <p>Just having the curriculum to follow is a great way for me to manage my workload. I do have a base knowledge coming in so managing additional learning to the base curriculum will be harder to track. Asking myself each week/day what I think should be achieveable would be a good way to manage it as it allows flexibility to learn more if I can or cut back if there it a lot of content to get through already.</p>
            <h2>How will I seek help:</h2>
            <p>I am quite comfortable in asking for help but I also like to struggle for a little bit because I think it brings a certain amount of growth in itself. I would be comfortable in asking my peers and the facilitators for help - I would just want to know that I have exhausted my own efforts to solve an issue first.</p>
            <h2>What I expect from the facilitation team:</h2>
            <p>To be there to answer questions and to give feedback and motivation. Some things, I have found, can seem rather futile or senseless, just having someone to at least relate to the frustration is enough to give you the energy to persist.</p>
            <h2>My other commitments other than Dev Academy:</h2>
            <p>I actually don't have many commitments other than Dev Academy. One thing that I am cognizant of is my personal wellbeing. We are not robots and need time off to recover from things. I am going to respect my body and try my hardest to listen to it when it needs something.</p>
