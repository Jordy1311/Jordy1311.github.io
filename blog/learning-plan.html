            <h1>MY LEARNING PLAN AT DEV ACADEMY</h1>
            <img src="/images//man-using-laptop.jpeg" alt="man using macbook" class="post-photo">
            <h2>Long term goal and/or career pathway:</h2>
            <p>My 15 week longterm goal at Dev Academy would be to become a more rounded developer. I completely understand the need for some knowledge but I love that there is a need for more people who have both good people skills and the ability to learn when facing difficulties. We are in a world where things are constantly updating with new releases and these two key skills is a solid way through it, making way for the creation of more great things.</p>
            <h2>My strengths and limitations in learning:</h2>
            <p>My strengths include being patient and trusting that the curriculum and facilitators are working in my best interest and other general things like picking things up fast and asking questions that solidify understanding. I think where I have limitations is having the confidence to raise points of conflict where a matter is subjective or presenting to bigger groups! Speeches give me anxiety but not because I don't have well informed opinions or because I don't know something - I think it has to do with judgement or something!</p>
            <h2>Skills I would like to see developed:</h2>
            <p>Those people skills that bring more collaboration: presentation, group problem solving. More understanding around bigger concepts as well. I know that it would be hard to fit the whole development world in 15 weeks but at least having conceptual understand of best practices would give me confidence in what I am doing and why.</p>
            <h2>How will I manage my workload:</h2>
            <p>Just having the curriculum to follow is a great way for me to manage my workload. I do have a base knowledge coming in so managing additional learning to the base curriculum will be harder to track. Asking myself each week/day what I think should be achieveable would be a good way to manage it as it allows flexibility to learn more if I can or cut back if there it a lot of content to get through already.</p>
            <h2>How will I seek help:</h2>
            <p>I am quite comfortable in asking for help but I also like to struggle for a little bit because I think it brings a certain amount of growth in itself. I would be comfortable in asking my peers and the facilitators for help - I would just want to know that I have exhausted my own efforts to solve an issue first.</p>
            <h2>What I expect from the facilitation team:</h2>
            <p>To be there to answer questions and to give feedback and motivation. Some things, I have found, can seem rather futile or senseless, just having someone to at least relate to the frustration is enough to give you the energy to persist.</p>
            <h2>My other commitments other than Dev Academy:</h2>
            <p>I actually don't have many commitments other than Dev Academy. One thing that I am cognizant of is my personal wellbeing. We are not robots and need time off to recover from things. I am going to respect my body and try my hardest to listen to it when it needs something.</p>
