            <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
            <p>
              I had done a bit of coding before jumping into this but I did find that I really like coding around others - It allows you to use their different perspective on a particular problem if you need help or an opinion and they might be a bit better at something which you might not have had as much exposure to. That just goes to show that two heads really are better than the one!
            </p>
            <p>
              Another thing I have noticed is I really like to help and try teach. I see the struggle that I felt once upon and I just can't help but to feel emapthy and try and bare some of that load and make sure they know that it is a hump I too have come across and that it does get easier. Coding sometimes doesn't come naturally but like anything gets easier with practice.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also found that I am quite passionate about the bigger picture which I think the software industry is hyper-focused on too. I am really happy amongst it and I think it is the perfect thing for me!!
            </p>
            <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
            <p>
              It allows one to know why and how to go about things. You might be persuing this career path because of a particular reason - knowing your values means that you can lean on these when things get tough and keep you grounded/focused when things are going amazingly or potentially terribly. The empathy and self-awareness gives you focus of those around you and also how you are doing inside. You can guage a room to see how they would respond to what you might say and be able to look after yourself when things get stressful or appriciate things when they are going good.
            </p>
            <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
            <p>
              This is something that I have spoken about in my Journal: the amount of focus on Core/Human Skills. I know it is based off what the industry is needing and I think that is cool. It leads to better working teams in environments that are more sustainable to the individual, company and whoever the consumer ends up being.
            </p>
            <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
            <p>
              Probably the amount of time it can take but also the fact that it can go pretty deep which likely leads to the amount of time taken. You could definitely get lost in this sort of area but I think, no matter how much time you spend there, it is always worth it. There is a lot of focus on your position in the world nowadays and I think taking a moment to look inward to see where/how you are in the moment is very much needed.
            </p>
            <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
            <p>
              To create well rounded people. You don't just need people that know things, you need people that can work together, can adapt to changes and be able to problem solve effectively. It really is a more sustainable/repeatable way of learning.
            </p>
            <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
            <p>
              I don't think it was a waste of time. I think I am already pretty self-aware but all of this Core has only solidified the reasons that I am here and ways that I can make sure that I am always moving forward however small of a move that is.
