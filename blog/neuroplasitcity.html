            <h2>Neuroplasicity</h2>
            <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people:</h3>
            <p>
              Understanding Neuroplasticity means that you know your brain will adapt to a certain environment given the right stimulus - neural paths are strengthened and widened with consistent use. Knowing this means that you understand the reasoning behind the saying “practice makes perfect” and makes it less likely for you to question why you are repeating something that you already know - you are merely reinforcing knowledge.
            </p>
            <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit:</h3>
            <p>
              The clear and most important principle of neuroplasticity would be practising - firing those neural paths so they become easier to fire in the future (i.e. recalling and applying knowledge). While practising itself is good, making sure to keep that practice consistent over time will mean that you don't succumb to the “use it or lose it” phenomenon. The last thing that you need to keep in mind, is to make sure that you're practising the right things; practising a bad habit will enforce that bad habit just as it would for a good habit. Applying this to myself would mean: practice practice practice, making sure to keep that consistent, ensuring I am practising good habits.
            </p>
            <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
            <p>
              As mentioned above, making sure that you're always practising, that it is consistent practice and that it is focused on the right things means that you're maximising your neuroplasticity potential.

            <h2>The Growth Mindset</h2>
            <img src="/images/growth-mindset.jpeg" alt="two drawn heads showing a fixed and growth mindset" class="post-photo">
            <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant:</h3>
            <p>
              A growth mindset is knowing that your mind is not limited/static in terms of it’s capacity but rather through persistence in failure you can grow that capacity. It is extremely relevant, in the development world especially, because it is just simply impossible know and understand everything there is about everything. With a growth mindset, one might feel static in terms of their current knowledge but having that mindset would comfort them in the process of learning more and potentially failing along the way - knowing that time spent learning and time failing is sometimes a byproduct of learning.
            </p>
            <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
            <p>
              We have covered this topic in the past but I do remember when I first covered it, a growth mindset did challenge my understanding of how the brain works. I don't think I've ever specifically taught that some people are smarter than others but I guess you just assume that that is the case because when people don't have a growth mindset they usually stay at their current level of knowledge whereas if somebody has a growth mindset they would eventually be seen as smart. This new knowledge definitely gives me more courage to tackle things that are harder because it somehow makes them seem more possible and that if I do struggle then that is just a symptom of learning.
            </p>
            <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
            <p>
              I don't think I couldn't integrate growth mindset into my learning. Maybe just having to remind myself when I get to something that is hard, that my current feelings are just symptoms of learning and that if I persist and the symptoms I will eventually pop out the other side with the knowledge that I was intending to gain.
            </p>

            <h2>Blending this into my learning plan:</h2>
            <p>
              Even though by the time I wrote my learning plan we had covered a growth mindset, I don't think I integrated into my learning plan at all. It would be a good thing to include into wherever I find something challenging as it's natural to start questioning your ability in those times rather than think that your current experiences in terms of difficulty is just learning playing out in the real world.
