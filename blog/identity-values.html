            <h1>MY IDENTITY, VALUES & STRENGTHS</h1>
            <img src="/images/do-something-great.jpg" alt="neon sign that says do something great" class="post-photo">
            <p>I have actually already done a Myers Briggs personality test and my results really resonate with my daily struggles and things that I think are my strengths; also very interesting that people can generally be grouped into only 16 different types!
            <br><br>
            The results say that I am an Architect (INTJ) and that is a person who has Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging personality traits; all of which I completely agree with.
          <br><br>
            Reading through the strengths and weaknesses, I am totally brought down to earth because reading through my personality's weaknesses, I completely agree with them! Which only confirms the findings because being overly critical is one of them! Obviously this includes myself! To lighten the mood, I do think that I agree with strengths too</p>
            <h2>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values:</h2>
            <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make:</h3>
            <p>This is totally an interview question and for some reason the only example that comes straight to the front of my mind is when I was working as a Service Desk Supervisor of a team. I started as a member of the team I was Supervisor to so naturally had good friends in that team. A situation arose, I can't remember the specifics, but I had to go through performance management with a very good friend - we gymed together on the daily, we were that close! The big ethical decision that I had was this is my good friend but my work-place have identified behaviour or pattern that they didn't agree with. How was I going to walk the line of doing my job as supervisor and being a friend. Luckily for my personality I am unreservedly critical which brought into question my friends behaviour but also my workplace's expectations. The ethical decision came to the conclusion that my workplace's expectations were unreasonable but because me and the subject of the perfomance managing were such good friends we were able to devise a plan that would mean work were happy enough and he was comfortable too. Oh the lowe of a small conflict of interest!</p>
            <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity:</h3>
            <p>I am not a person who is from a very diverse culture. I am very fortunate to have been brought up by my mum who has always fostered a culture of trust, openness and respect. It has deffinately complemented my personality which has somen huge negatives such as arogance and dismissing emotion. My mum is hugely compassionate and totally willing to sacrifice even to the point of her own disadvantage! I have such huge respect for her and she totally is one of my heros.</p>
            <h2>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations:</h2>
            <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development:</h3>
            <p>Another very deep question! Lets start with my weakness and finish on a high note. I would say that a certain level of arogance still exists - maybe not outwardly expressed but in terms of how I consider my solutions to problems. I can totally see this potentially causing conflict in my mind if something/some solution/a new path is suggested in a workplace or learning environment which I don't totally agree with and then to compound on top of that another potential issue with my personality is that I am introverted (totally agree) and that doesn't mean I can't talk to people but sheesh does conflict burn my energy and it is really something that I need to work on. Lets move to something more positive. I am really lucky to have the strengths that I do. I really like that I think a lot! That has obvious advantages in a learning and working environment. I also like that I am generally independent and very rational. All of that puts me in a very good position to work well by myself. Maybe something that I do need to keep in mind is that I should make sure that I am improving my teamworking abilities.</p>
            <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles:</h3>
            <p>I think just as I have said in the last part of the last question, thinking, being independent and being rational are great things to go into learning with. Again though, working in a team I need to make sure that ideas are brought up productively and that I respect others' ideas while also being comfortable if there is conflict in ideas and bringing productive (again with that word) discussion around it.</p>
            <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension:</h3>
            <p>It has happened in the past where I think my way of doing something is the best way of doing that thing and it has been proven it wasn't; probably much to the delight of who I was working with too. I just need to keep in mind that just because I have formulated a solution in my head using all of my past experience and knowledge, there's no way for me to experience everything or have all of the knowledge so should always value others' opinion!! Sheesh I sound arrogant. These are example from the very bad side. Most often I am quite and reserved hah!</p>
