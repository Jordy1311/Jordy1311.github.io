                <h1>JAVASCRIPT & DOM EXPLORATION</h1>

                <h2>Lets talk analogies re. HTML and CSS:</h2>
                <p>HTML and CSS creates a house. Let me explain how:</p>
                <img src="/images/html-css-js-house.webp" alt="house showing how html css and Javascript are related" class="post-photo-small">
                <p>
                    HTML is the frame of the house: how many floors the house will have, where the walls will be, and which room you will put certain furniture and appliances. Likewise for a website, HTML sets out code sections (storeys/walls) and which sections will house which elements including text and images (furniture/appliances).
                </p>
                <p>
                    CSS would then be the specific design and positioning of everything: the type of wallpaper or paint, color of the flooring, how big the rooms are, where exactly in the room the furniture and applicances are positioned. Same goes for a website, CSS sets the colors of the page or elements (floors/walls/rooms), how big elements will be (floor/room sizes) and where in the element text and images will be (furniture and appliance positioning).
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an extra to this anaolgy Javascript can be seen as the functionality of the house: the doorbell ringing when pressed, turning the TV on from the input from the remote and the dishwasher washing the dishes. Likewise, Javascript can hook onto elements in the DOM and with events from the user (clicking doorbell & clicking the remote button) can provide certain functionality or feedback (doorbell ringing & TV turning on).
                </p>

            <h2>Lets talk more analogies but re. loops and flow:</h2>
            <h3>Looping:</h3>
            <p>
                Lets start with looping. Looping, as the name describes, is for actions that happen more than once due to a certain condition having not been met yet. The first thing that comes to my mind is washing the dishes - reeeaally exciting stuff I know but persist the urge to stop reading, it does make some sense!
            </p>
            <p>
                When you first start the dishes, if you are of the organised type, you have a pile of dirty dishes to one side and the other side: the destination for the clean ones. You start your loop with the conditions of starting at the start and continuing with the next until you have no dishes left. The loop itself would go:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                forLoop (start at 0; continue until all clean; move onto next) {<br>
                    grabDirtyDish();<br>
                    cleanDirtyDish();<br>
                    placeCleanDishOnCleanSide();<br>
                }
            </p>
            <p>
                The important part of difference here is the fact the loop repeats and that behaviour defines a loop. Boundaries are defined, actions are set and take place and actions stop once certain criteria are met. In this example the certain criteria was all the dishes being clean.
            </p>
            <h3>Flow:</h3>
            <p>
                Now to Flow. Generally speaking, flow is more for actions that happen once but might have a few potential outcomes. As a coffee fanatic and with how my brain is in the morning, there is a chance of producing a garbage cup of coffee, lets look at this.
            </p>
            <p>
                You start at the start with an empty cup and a longing for a great brew and there are two potential outcomes: brewing a good and drinkable cup or a garbage and drain-worthy cup. This flow might take place like this:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                boilWater();<br><br>
                grindBeans();<br><br>
                brew();<br><br>
                if (coffeeGood) {<br>
                    sitBack();<br>
                    drinkUp();<br>
                } else {<br>
                    destroyGarbageCoffee();<br>
                }
            </p>
            <p>
                Admittedly, this is a terrible anaolgy because it would actually become a loop for me if it was my first cup of coffee or the weekend but as above, it does show flow!! There are two different paths should different things happen: if I make a good cup of coffee then I can enjoy it. If it was a bad cup of coffee then I would drain that and move on with life.
            </p>
            <p>
                To sum these great analogies up, loops loop and flow flows. It is easiest to explain these as mutually exclusive but in real life you could possibly see some paths of flow within a looping section of code!!
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have made it to this point, I commend you!! Forgive me, analogies are hard!!
            </p>

            <h2>DOM who??</h2>
            <p>
                The DOM or Document Object Model is a tree like structure that defines relationships between elements and their containing elements. If an element is contained in another, it is said that the containing element is the element's parent and to view it from the other perspective the element is the containing element's child. NOTE: containing elements can have many children and just like trying to do something with a real life parent with a lot of children, things can get messy! Let's dive into this a bit further.
            </p>
            <img src="/images/DOM-example.png" alt="example of the DOM as a inverse tree" class="post-photo">
            <p>
                The DOM opens up dynamically changing things in your HTML with Javascript. Think things like clicking this button now makes something disappear or submitting this form will give Javascript the form field entries. This now makes your site dynamic; ie: it will respond to certain inputs as you have coded.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way this works, in vanilla Javascript, is it latches onto elements in the HTML file via either it's ID or, if an ID isn't present, by describing another attribute of the target element (for example: symantic tag or present class name). Once the element is successfully selected, you provide a trigger (for example: a mouse click or mouse down/up), then you give a function of what will happen when this trigger event fires for the selected element. It could be: add this class to the element or change the element text. Easy as that and the function can be as long or as short and do as much or as little as you want!
            </p>
            <p>To dive in deeper, follow the link to <u><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model" target="__blank" class="a-text">the DOM</a></u>.</p>

            <h2>Lets talk about accessing data in arrays and objects:</h2>
            <h3>Arrays:</h3>
            <img src="/images/js-array.png" alt="example of a Javascript array" class="post-photo-small">
            <p>
                Firstly, an array is a special variable that can hold more than one value and/or value type at one time. This is a great thing if you needed to store a few values that are all related in some way. An example of data that would be good in an array is colours or car brands.
            </p>
            <p>
                To access this data you have to give the array name and specify the index of the array that you want to retrieve. NOTE: array indexes are 0 based so the indexes of an array that has the length of 3 would be 0, 1, 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the example above, to retrieve the value of 30, I would need to code:</p>
            <p class="code">scores[2]</p>
            <p>
                There are other methods of retreiving and working with the values in an array such as looping over and finding an index of a value. Follow the link if you want to learn more about <u><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#:~:text=these%20named%20properties.-,Common%20operations,-Create%20an%20Array" target="__blank" class="a-text">Javascript arrays</a></u>.</p>
            <h3>Objects:</h3>
            <img src="/images/js-object.png" alt="example of a Javascript object" class="post-photo-small">
            <p>
                Javascript objects are also special variables that can hold more than one value and/or value type at a time but for each value, there is an associate key which is a reference for the value. NOTE: Javascript objects can even have functions as values!!
            </p>
            <p>
                Accessing data within an object is very similar to an array. In the example above, for me to retreive my favourite number I would have to type:
            </p>
            <p class="code">Jordan[faveNum]</p>
            <p>
                Again there are other methods of retreiving and working with values in objects; there are even more than arrays considering you can have functions as values. There is also something called a constructor if you are going to be creating multiple instances of an object with the same keys for each, for example a person; every person should have firstName and lastName etc.. Follow the link if you want to learn more about <u><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#:~:text=your%20own%20objects.-,Objects%20overview,-Objects%20in%20JavaScript" target="__blank" class="a-text">Javascript objects</a></u>.</p>

            <!-- Explain what functions are and why they are useful. -->
            <h2>What the func are we even talking about?!</h2>
            <p>
                A function in Javascript is a callable set of actions that together perform a task or calculate something. There can be inputs that the function will use in it's actions and it can return something back to the function caller after performing it's actions.
            </p>
            <p>
                They are very useful for those sets of actions that will need to be executed in many places of your code. For example, if you have a game and a score point system, an obvious function there is updateScore which could take who scored and maybe how much they scored and then apply the correct score amount to the correct variable and maybe even perform a check that would execute another function if one of the players gets a winning amount of points.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another massive thing just brought up in that example was a function being called in a function: a function if someone wins or loses. You can even have functions that call themselves in order to repeat code, like in a loop, until certain criteria is met; this is called a recursive function.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are unlimited possibilities and a lot of spaces where you brain thinking might hurt but if follow the link if you want to learn more about <u><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions#:~:text=know%20the%20details.-,Defining%20functions,-Function%20declarations" target="__blank" class="a-text">Javascript functions</a></u>.
