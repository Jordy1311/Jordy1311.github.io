            <h2>Lets talk analogies re. HTML and CSS:</h2>
            <p>HTML and CSS creates a house. Let me explain how:
                <br><br>
                HTML is the frame of the house: how many floors the house will have, where the walls will be, and which room you will put furniture/appliances. Likewise, for a website, HTML sets out code sections (walls/storeys) and which sections will house which elements including text and images (furniture/appliances).
                <br><br>
                CSS would then be the specific design and positioning of everything: the type of wallpaper or paint/color of the flooring, how big the rooms are, where exactly in the room the furniture/applicances is/are positioned. Same goes for a website, CSS sets the colors of the page or elements (walls/floors/rooms), how big elements will be (floor/room sizes) and where in the element will text and images be (furniture and appliance positioning).
                <br><br>
                As an extra to this anaolgy JavaScript can be seen as the functionality of the house: the doorbell ringing when pressed, turning the TV from the input from the remote and starting the dishwasher after dinner. Likewise, JavaScript can hook onto events from the user (clicking doorbell & remote button clicking) and provide certain functionality or feedback (doorbell ringing & TV showing you the news).
            </p>
            <!-- Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones). -->
            <h2>Lets talk more analogies but re. loops and flow:</h2>
            <p>Lets start with looping. Looping is, as the name describes, for actions that happens more than once due to a certain condition not having been met yet. The first thing that comes to my mind is washing the dishes - reeeaally exciting stuff I know but persist the urge to stop reading, it does make some sense!

                <br><br>
                Now on to Flow. Flow is more for something that happens once but might have a few potential outcomes. As I'm a coffee fanatic and how my brain is in the morning has a chance of producing a crappy cup of coffee, lets look at this.

            <!-- Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it. -->
            <h2>DOM who??</h2>
            <p></p>
            <!-- Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects. -->
            <h2>Lets talk about accessing data in arrays and objects:</h2>
            <p></p>
            <!-- Explain what functions are and why they are useful. -->
            <h2>What the func are we even talking about?!</h2>
