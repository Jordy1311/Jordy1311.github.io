            <h1>PROBLEM SOLVING</h1>
            <img src="/images/problem-solving.jpeg" alt="scarbble letters - focus on remedies not faults" class="post-photo">
            <p>Welcome to my post on problem-solving. Let's take a look at the problems that I've had in the past and a few methods of problem-solving for the future!</p>
            <h2>Talk about a time you got blocked on a simple problem:</h2>
            <p>
              The simple problems that I've had usually stem from some sort of syntax error and what I mean by that is I miss-type something or forget to close a bracket or during re-factoring I forget to delete a redundant bracket. For those that don't know much about code, brackets are funny markers for computers that tell the computer that this particular block of code that is within these brackets is a certain section that might need to be repeated or be run under certain circumstances. Annoyingly, if there's an extra closing bracket or opening bracket, because computers are very strict when interpreting a language, instead of applying some sort of logic and fixing it for you, it just stops executing and pushes the problem back to the developer to fix. 
              <br><br>
              To fix these problems you have to look very closely at the error messages when trying to run the file and being very careful when you are writing and re-factoring code. Honestly, these can be some of the most annoying problems because it could've been a very simple change that just you made that all of a sudden breaks everything and everything looks as you would've expected. 
              <br><br>
              The things I learn from these small problems is to take my time when I'm coding and not gloss over error messages because sometimes they have very useful information on them.
            </p>
            <h2>Now a time where you solved a problem in an elegant way:</h2>
            <p>
              One elegant solution that I had to a problem involved taking a step back and actually deleting a bunch of complexity and replacing it with a nice section of simplicity. The situation was, I had a function that output a number code to a certain length and the problem was I needed to be able to include letters with the numbers. Unfortunately my problem-solving technique was to just jump in and start coding. I ended up with a block of code that was really complex and had multiple steps that were different for both the letters and the numbers. In my head I could see that things were getting complicated and I paused for a second and thought “what I'm try to achieve here it's really simple why am I trying to make it so complex?”.
              <br><br>
              I had a really good idea to completely simplify the whole situation by only having one step to get both letters and numbers and in a really simple way. It felt amazing! It was like I was hiking uphill and all of a sudden I turned around and started hiking downhill instead.
              <br><br>
              The great lesson I learnt was: keep it simple!
            </p>
            <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h2>
            <h3>Pseudocode:</h3>
            <p>
              Pseudocode is amazing. It allows me to dump all the ideas in my head about the problem, order them in a way that makes sense in code and then that keeps me on track to solve the problem and not veer off into another code space. I am very happy in using pseudocode.
            </p>
            <h3>Trying something:</h3>
            <p>
              Often times when I just jump in and try something I lead myself down a track that isn't helpful. There is though, times when you just need to jump in and try something and there's always being able to console.log in order to see what's going on and then moving on to try something else.
            </p>
            <h3>Rubber ducky method:</h3>
            <p>
              Interestingly, I have actually used this method without knowing the name or what Dev Academy calls it. When I get really stuck, especially in loops and reclusive functions, I find stepping through the function and explaining each step as if I’m explaining it to somebody who doesn't know how to code brings up the obvious flaw in the function.
            </p>
            <h3>Reading error messages:</h3>
            <p>
              Other than when the error message hits the nail on the head in terms of describing the actual error, I'm not too comfortable in reading error messages and I don't have the confidence to follow a call stack which I know would be a great skill to have especially when things go wrong. Instead what I do is, I fall onto another problem-solving technique which eventually solves the problem.

            </ul>
            <h3>Console.logging:</h3>
            <p>
              I love console.loging probably a bit too much...
            </p>
            <h3>Googling:</h3>
            <p>
              Googling is great. There's a lot of good information out there and because the language is that we are using have been around for awhile and a lot of people use them, chances are somebody has had the exact same problem and googling a good phrase is all you need to find the answer.
            </p>
            <h3>Asking your peers for help:</h3>
            <p>
              At the moment, because we are all so new, I'm only really comfortable and asking my peers if they've had the same problem and then maybe running the problem by them briefly before trying to feel whether or not they understand the problem otherwise I would likely fall onto another problem-solving technique. 
            </p>
            <h3>Asking coaches for help:</h3>
            <p>
              I love interacting with people but I hate asking for help and finding out that the problem was tiny and was really caused by my own overlooking. This might be an indication that I struggle at this problem-solving technique but at the same time it does save sometime because I only really ask for help when I've exhausted all other avenues.
            </p>
            <h3>Improving your process with reflection:</h3>
            <p>
              I think the thing that I get from reflection is appreciation for the struggle that I've been through. I think that means when I come into another problem that's similar I can at least fall back on the realisation from the past problem that this problem will pass and I don't need to get too stuck on it.
